# Boreal

Mountainous regions during spring and autumn and milder regions during the winter season both exhibit weather patterns consistent with the Boreal climate.  This climate pattern also represents the transition zone between temperate and polar regions.

**Example [Natural Hazards](../../Exploration-Rules/Hazards-and-Encounters#term-natural-hazard):** a frozen trail, a rickety bridge, a dangerously steep incline.

The effects of snow on the difficulty of navigating a path in a Boreal region are represented by a value called the _<dfn id = "term-snowpack">Snowpack</dfn>,_ which is a modifier that the [GM](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-gm) adds to the [navigation difficulty](../../Exploration-Rules/Nodes-and-Paths#term-navigation-difficulty) of the path during the [navigation roll](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-navigation-roll).  At the end of a Snowy day, this value increases by 1, at the end of a day with a Snowstorm it increases by 2, at the end of a Rainy day it drops by 1, and after the end of a Sunny day it drops by 1d4.  The value of the Snowpack in a Boreal region can never be greater than 5.
