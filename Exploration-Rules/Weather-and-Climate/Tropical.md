# Tropical

Jungles, the summer months in hotter regions, and the wet season on islands are all represented by the Tropical climate.  Equatorial wetlands tend to also have Tropical climates or similar.

**Example Natural Hazards:** thick foliage, a leech-filled swamp, a surging river.

Tropical regions are rife with small animals, poisonous plants, dirty water, and microorganisms, all of which are intent on causing the [player characters](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player-character) as much misery as possible.  If the [party](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-party) runs out of Supplies, they will receive the [Poisoned](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses#term-poisoned) status effect in addition to the usual [injury](../../Combat-Rules/Death-and-Injury#term-injury) due to deprivation.
