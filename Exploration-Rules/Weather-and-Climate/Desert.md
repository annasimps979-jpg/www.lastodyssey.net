# Desert

Arid, hot regions such as canyons, plateaus, or sandy deserts are represented by the Desert climate.  Characters traveling in these regions should be careful to bring more [Supplies](../../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory/Travel-Items#term-supplies) than normal.

**Example [Natural Hazards](../../Exploration-Rules/Hazards-and-Encounters#term-natural-hazard):** quicksand, a mirage, a deep canyon.

In the dry air of a Desert region, [characters](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) will lose far more moisture than normal.  To represent this, the [players](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) must spend 1 additional unit of Supplies in total during the [Camping Phase](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-camping-phase) in order to avoid taking an [injury](../../Combat-Rules/Death-and-Injury#term-injury).
