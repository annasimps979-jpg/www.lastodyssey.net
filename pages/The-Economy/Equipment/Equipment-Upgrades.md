# Equipment Upgrades

In addition to buying new [equipment](../../The-Economy/Equipment), [players](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) can also purchase the addition or removal of [upgrades](../../The-Economy/Equipment#term-equipment-upgrade) for existing equipment by paying a professional who specializes in doing so.  To remove an upgrade from a piece of equipment costs 100 [cr](../../The-Economy#term-cr) times the total [Upgrade Value](../../The-Economy/Equipment#term-upgrade-value) it takes up on the equipment.  To add an upgrade to a piece of equipment costs an amount of cr equal to the difference between what the equipment would cost with the upgrade and what the equipment would cost without it, plus 500 cr, 1000 cr, or 5000 cr if the upgrade has an Upgrade Value of 1, 2, or 3, respectively.  Regardless of how it's done, upgrading a piece of equipment is a painstaking process, and will take a number of days equal to 1d4 multiplied by the UV of the upgrade.  Professionals capable of producing precisely the upgrade that players want are rare, and finding one for more powerful upgrades is an appropriate goal for a [quest](../../Free-Play/Quests).
