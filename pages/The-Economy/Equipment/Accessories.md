# Accessories

An _<dfn id = "term-accessory">accessory</dfn>_ is a kind of item that is worn on the body but is not a piece of armor.  There are three types of accessories: Head, Arm, and Loop.  [Characters](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) may wear up to one Head accessory, two Arm accessories (one for both arms), and two Loop accessories (one on their neck and one on their waist) at a time.  Characters of any tier can wear any type of accessory, but characters may only wear a number of accessories at a time equal to their tier divided by two, at a minimum of 1.  This means that tier 1 characters can wear 1 accessory at a time, while tier 10 characters can wear 5 at a time, one on their Head, two on their Arms, and two Loops.

There are no stacking Quality levels for accessories, but there are three unique types of accessory for each slot.  _<dfn id = "term-lucky-accessory">Lucky</dfn>_ accessories grant a +1 bonus to their wearer's [Evasion](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-evasion), and _<dfn id = "term-mystical-accessory">Mystical</dfn>_ accessories grant a +1 bonus to their [Resistance](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-resistance).  Both Lucky and Mystical accessories can have the same [upgrades](../../The-Economy/Equipment#term-equipment-upgrade) attached to them, one upgrade per accessory.  There are also more powerful _<dfn id = "term-unique-accessory">Unique</dfn>_ accessories, but these do not give you bonuses to your Evasion or Resistance.  In terms of [merchant](../../The-Economy/Merchants) offerings and [quest](../../Free-Play/Quests) rewards, characters will have access to Lucky and Mystical accessories at tiers 1-5, while characters above tier 5 will have access to Uniques as well.

## Accessory Upgrades

### Partial

|Upgrade|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Shield|This type of accessory grants a +1 to either your [Physical](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-defense) or [Magical Defense](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-defense).  This effect can stack with other bonuses of the same type.|
|Resonance|When you are wearing an accessory of this type, when you hit an enemy with an [ability](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability) of the specified [elemental type](../../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-elemental-type), it hits them as though you had rolled a 10 regardless of what the actual result of your attack or [status-inflicting ability](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-status-inflicting-ability) roll was.  This effect does not stack with other effects of the same type, but you can have multiple elemental resonances at once.|
|Supporting|Wearing this accessory grants you [proficiency](../../Characters/Character-Creation#term-armor-proficiency) with a specified type of [weapon](../../The-Economy/Equipment/Weapons) or [armor](../../The-Economy/Equipment/Weapons).  This does not stack, but you can wear accessories that give you multiple different proficiencies at the same time.|
|Volatile|When you use an ability that costs [MP](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mp) while wearing this accessory, roll the [outcome die](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-outcome-die).  If the result is greater than 5, the ability does not cost any MP, while if the result is 5 or below, the ability costs double MP.  If you cannot afford the double MP cost in the latter case, the ability still activates but you immediately drop to 0 MP.|
|Item Sleeve|When you use the item specified by this upgrade that involves rolling the outcome die, you may roll an additional outcome die and freely choose which result you take.  If this is not involved, it instead doubles the item's potency or adds an extra [enhancement](../../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory/Battle-Items#term-item-enhancement).  For example, a healing item that normally heals 10 [HP](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-hp) will now heal 20, or an Item Sleeve for a Scan item will turn it into Multiscan.|
|Linked Ability|When you are wearing this accessory, you gain the use of an ability specified by the upgrade for double its usual MP cost.|
|[Mana](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mana) Battery|This accessory has a linked pool of 5 temporary MP that you can draw on while you are wearing it rather than your base MP pool.  This MP resets at the beginning of every [battle](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-battle).|
|Scanner|While you are wearing this accessory, you can use the Scan ability without spending any MP.|
|Elemental Resistance|While wearing this accessory, all elemental damage of the specified type that you take is multiplied by 0.5 in addition to any other modifiers.  This effect cannot stack with any other resistances you have to the same elemental type.|
|Targeting|This Accessory gives you a +1 to one of your [Accuracies](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-accuracy) while you are wearing it.  This bonus can stack with any other bonuses of the same type.|

### Total

|Upgrade|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Summon Creature|Once per battle while you are wearing this accessory, you may spend 2 [AP](../../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-ap) to summon the creature into the battle.  When it is first summoned, it will enter the [initiative order](../../Combat-Rules/Starting-Battles#term-initiative-order) as though this were the first [round](../../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-round) of [combat](../../Combat-Rules), and can begin acting during the following round but can be targeted during the round it was first summoned.|
|Elemental Shield|While you are wearing this accessory, you are immune to a single elemental damage type, not including [colorless](../../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-colorless) damage.  This does not stack, but you can be immune to multiple elemental damage types at once.|
|Targe|This ability gives you the Block ability.  Block has no MP cost, but multiplies the damage of the next [physical attack](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-physical-attack) that hits you by 0.5 in addition to other modifiers.  If you do not Block any attacks before the end of your next turn, this effect goes away.|
|Soul Sink|The first time you undergo [True Death](../../Free-Play/True-Death) while wearing this accessory, it will reconstitute you back to 1 HP, regardless of how badly you were injured.  However, after the first time you die while wearing this accessory, you cannot take it off again, or you will instantly and permanently die.|
|Chameleon|While you are wearing this accessory, you can use the [Dancer's](../../Characters/Archetypes/Dancer) Costume Change ability without spending any MP.  If you are a Dancer, this also reduces the cost of the ability to 1 AP.|
|Protection Against Monsters|When you take damage from an attack made by an enemy of the type specified by this item, it is multiplied by a factor of 0.5 in addition to other multipliers.|
|Auto Heal|During the [Effect Phase](../../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-effect-phase) of every round, if you are wearing this accessory you automatically heal for 5 HP.  While you are [downed](../../Combat-Rules/Death-and-Injury#term-downed), this accessory does nothing.|
|Grant Edge|At the start of a battle, if you are wearing this accessory, you gain a +1 to your [base](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-base) [Initiative](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-initiative).  This bonus can stack with any other bonuses to Initiative that you have.|
|Absorb Magic|If you are attacked by a [magical attack](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-magical-attack) of the specified elemental type while wearing this accessory, you gain an amount of HP equal to the damage you would have taken had the attack hit you.|
|Reciprocity|Any [debuff](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-debuff), [status](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses), or [buff](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-buff) that any character applies to you is also applied by you to them.  This includes statuses such as [Taunted](../../Characters/Jobs/Defender), Guarded, and [Hunted](../../Characters/Archetypes/Ranger), but does not include the effects of other abilities like [Shells](../../Combat-Rules/Shells).  Any effects you apply to yourself are only applied once.|
