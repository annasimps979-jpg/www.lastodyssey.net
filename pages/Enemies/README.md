# Enemies

In Last Odyssey, every [character](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) that is capable of fighting the [player characters](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player-character) in [combat](../Combat-Rules/) is called an _<dfn id = "term-enemy">enemy</dfn>._  Not every [NPC](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-npc) is an enemy, but any NPCs that also have a set of corresponding combat [statistics](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-statistic) and give the player characters [XP](../Characters/Character-Advancement#term-experience-points) when they die count.

Each enemy on the battlefield has combat statistics and a set of [abilities](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability).  Enemies can also take any of the basic set of [actions](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-action) outlined in the [Combat Round](../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round) subsection of the [Combat Rules](../Combat-Rules/), with the exception of [Summon Eidolon](../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-summon-eidolon).  The [GM](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-gm) is responsible for narrating and controlling enemy behavior during [battle](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-battle).  However, rather than simply treating a battle as a chess match between them and the [players](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player), GMs should instead play them like characters.  This is especially important because learning enemy abilities and behavior is an intended part of the experience of playing Last Odyssey.  Here are some principles the GM should stick to when narrating combat:

1.  _Provide context._  Combat in Last Odyssey is an abstract representation of a fight rather than a straightforward simulation.  All actions taken by participating characters should also be things that they do in the narrative.  For example, rather than stating that only stating that an enemy uses the Fire Burst ability, the GM should also describe its appearance.
2.  _Hide enemy statistics._  The Scan ability and the mechanics around information assume that players will be ignorant of the current [HP](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-hp), [MP](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mp), [Shell](../Combat-Rules/Shells), statistics, and abilities of an enemy unless they put effort into learning them, and thus the GM should not reveal them unless the right conditions are met.
3.  _Tell players what they've done, and what's been done to them._  GMs should tell them how much damage they are doing to enemies, what [statuses](../Combat-Rules/Statuses) have been inflicted on all characters, and how much damage they are taking.

Enemies differ from player characters in a few important ways.  First, enemies begin with a Shell of their [elemental type](../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-elemental-type) in addition to their [HP](../Characters/Abilities-and-Statistics#term-hp).  Enemies also count as their elemental type for the purpose of calculating the damage they receive.  Finally, each enemy has a _<dfn id = "term-creature-type">creature type</dfn>,_ which is a single word that describes what kind of being it is.  In the base game, there are ten creature types: 
* _<dfn id = "term-human">Humans</dfn>_ are creatures that are or are approximate to human beings.
* _<dfn id= "term-construct">Constructs</dfn>_ are creatures that were deliberately created by another being.
* _<dfn id ="term-fairy">Fairies</dfn>_ are magical creatures that possess the power of charm and illusion.
* _<dfn id = "term-animal">Animals</dfn>_ are ordinary living beings that have a place in the ecosystem.
* _<dfn id = "term-demon">Demons</dfn>_ are creatures born of sin whose powers stem from corruption.
* _<dfn id = "term-angel">Angels</dfn>_ are creatures that embody virtue, and live in the heavens.
* _<dfn id = "term-elemental">Elementals</dfn>_ are creatures of pure elemental power.
* _<dfn id = "term-undead">Undead</dfn>_ are creatures that were created from the reanimated souls of the dead.
* _<dfn id = "term-dragon">Dragons</dfn>_ are creatures of sheer willpower that usually resemble reptiles.
* _<dfn id = "term-horror">Horrors</dfn>_ are creatures that are twisted, bent, or otherwise uncategorizable.

An enemy's description will list their [tier](../Characters/Character-Creation#term-tier), their creature type, their elemental type, and whether they are Normal, Elite, or an Antagonist for the purposes of XP calculation.  The header for every monster will look like this: ((XP Type) (Tier), (Creature Type), (Elemental Type)).  This will then be followed by their combat statistics and their abilities.

GMs who need to fill combat encounters with enemies for their [campaign](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-campaign) should consult the following sections:
* [Encounter Creation:](Encounter-Creation) A guide to creating and roleplaying combat encounters.
* [Enemy Creation:](Enemy-Creation) A step-by-step process for creating custom enemies.
* [Antagonists:](Antagonists/) Special enemies that move the plot forward, and can wield Anima.
* [Example Enemies:](Example-Enemies/) Ready-made enemies to put into your game world.
* [Enemy Sheet:](Last-Odyssey-Fillable-Enemy-Sheet.pdf) A page for recording information about custom enemies.
