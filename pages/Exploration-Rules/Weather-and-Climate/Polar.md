# Polar

The farthest reaches of the poles and glaciers and cold regions during the winter resemble the Polar climate.  It is also useful for representing the peak of a tall mountain range.

**Example [Natural Hazards](../../Exploration-Rules/Hazards-and-Encounters#term-natural-hazard):** fragile ice, a slippery slope, a deep snowbank.

## Weather Table

|Result|Weather|
|:-|:-|
|1-3|[Bright](../../Exploration-Rules/Weather-and-Climate#term-bright)|
|4-7|[Snowy](../../Exploration-Rules/Weather-and-Climate#term-snowy)|
|8-10|[Snowstorm](../../Exploration-Rules/Weather-and-Climate#term-snowstorm)|

Due to the cold, [player characters](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player-character) in Polar regions should always be wearing a Coldproof [Cloak](../../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory/Travel-Items#term-cloak) or piece of [armor](../../The-Economy/Equipment/Armor).  [Players](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) whose [characters](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) are not should roll the [outcome die](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-outcome-die) during each [Camping Phase](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-camping-phase) regardless of the weather.  Each character whose player rolls an 8 or above will develop the [Frostbitten](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses#term-frostbitten) [status](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses).  In Polar regions, the [navigation difficulty](../../Exploration-Rules/Nodes-and-Paths#term-navigation-difficulty) of a path is 5 greater than it otherwise would be due to the effects of snow blindness, ice, snow, and the shifting of the ground.
