# Free Play

One of the cornerstones of FRP is _free play,_ a state of the game in which the [actions](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-action) [players](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) can take are not strictly delineated by the rules for system such as [combat](../Combat-Rules/) or the [travel round](../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round), but rather determined by the context of the narrative and by the rulings made by the [GM](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-gm).  The following section is a guide to the mechanics and frameworks that exist in Last Odyssey that GMs can use to facilitate free play while following Last Odyssey's mechanical and storytelling principles.
