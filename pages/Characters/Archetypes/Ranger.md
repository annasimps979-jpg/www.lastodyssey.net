## Advancements by Rank

**Rank 1:** Ability.

|Name|[Type](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-ability-type)|Cost|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mark Target|[Ranged](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-ranged)|1 [AP](../../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-ap)|This ability inflicts the Hunted [status](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses) on the target.  When you use a [magical attack](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-magical-attack), [physical attack](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-physical-attack), or [status-inflicting ability](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-status-inflicting-ability) on the target, you roll the [hit die](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-hit-die) twice and choose the number you prefer.  This does not apply to attacks that target multiple [enemies](../../Enemies/).  Only one enemy can have the Hunted status inflicted on them per Ranger on your team.  If a Hunted enemy dies due to one of your attacks, you may immediately use Mark Target on another enemy at no AP cost.|

## Talents

**[Striker](../../Characters/Jobs/Striker):** True Strike.  When you use a physical attack against a Hunted enemy, you may remove the Hunted status in order to guarantee that you hit them regardless of the result of the hit die.

**[Caster](../../Characters/Jobs/Caster):** Detonate.  When an enemy triggers the effect of Lay Trap, you may use a single-target magical attack against them rather than a basic attack.  When you do so, you may roll the hit die twice and choose the result you prefer.

**[Healer](../../Characters/Jobs/Healer):** Rescuscitate.  You may use your Mark Target ability to apply the Watched status to one of your allies. When they drop to 0 [HP](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-hp) or below, the Watched status is removed, and they regain an amount of HP equal to your [Magical Attack](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-attack).  Only one ally may be Watched by you at a time.

**[Defender](../../Characters/Jobs/Defender):** Forcefield.  You may use the Mark Target ability to apply the Defended status to an ally.  The next time they are hit by a status-inflicting ability, a magical attack, or a physical attack, the damage or status is negated.  Only one ally may be Defended by you at a time.

**Support:** Herbal Medicine.  You may use the Mark Target ability to apply the Treated status to an ally.  Treated allies ignore the cumulative effects of all debuffs that have been applied to them, although this does not affect the position of any of their [statistics](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-statistic) on the [Bonus Tracker](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs).

**Saboteur:** Poison Arrow.  When an enemy is affected by the Lay Trap ability, you may choose to use a single-target status-inflicting ability on them instead of using your basic attack.  When you do so, roll the hit die as though the enemy were Hunted.
