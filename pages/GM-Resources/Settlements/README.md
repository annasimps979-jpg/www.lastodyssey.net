# Settlements

All stories, at their core, are about people, and the stories you tell in Last Odyssey are no different.  For safety and because we are social animals, human beings will almost always be found living together in settlements.  In Last Odyssey, a _<dfn id = "term-settlement">settlement</dfn>_ is a term that refers to a [node](../../Exploration-Rules/Nodes-and-Paths#term-node) or closely linked group of nodes where [players](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) can [rest](../../Free-Play/Resting) from traveling, buy goods and services, find information, and interact with [NPCs](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-npc) in order to advance the plot of the [campaign](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-campaign).  While in a settlement, the majority of what players will be doing will constitute [free play](../../Free-Play).  The following section presents a guide to creating settlements that closely fit the type of pattern that best facilitates the feeling of a Last Odyssey setting.

In Last Odyssey, settlements are rare, and large settlements are even rarer.  Travel is difficult and trade even moreso, resulting in a settlement pattern much like that of the postclassical era of human history.  When creating a new settlement in the [overworld](../../Exploration-Rules#term-overworld), [GMs](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-gm) should take into consideration its population, its layout, its culture, and its architecture, as well as other sensory details.  GMs are allowed and encouraged to break the mold, but the following section will focus on the major types of settlements that players will usually encounter.

Not every settlement or landmark in a given region needs to be counted in the overworld.  The reason for this is that not every place in the world will ever be relevant to the campaign.  Instead, the GM should focus on detailing settlements that meet one or more of the following criteria:
*  The settlement provides goods and services the players will be interested in buying.
*  The settlement is a place where players can offload goods and perform labor in exchange for [currency](../../The-Economy#term-cr).
*  The settlement is a place to rest on the way to somewhere more important.
*  The settlement has employment for adventurers, or is the destination of a given [quest](../../Free-Play/Quests).
*  The settlement has [Lore](../../Free-Play/Lore) the players can learn by exploring it.

This section contains advice for creating five different kinds of settlement:
* [Villages:](Villages) The smallest kind of settlement, where people live close to one another and to the land.
* [Towns:](Towns) Larger agglomerations of people that exist to facilitate trade and commerce.
* [Cities:](Cities) Region-defining settlements that may be home to hundreds of thousands of people.
* [Metropoli:](Metropoli) The largest type of city, and a world unto itself.
* [Landmarks:](Landmarks) Other types of settlements not included in the above list.
