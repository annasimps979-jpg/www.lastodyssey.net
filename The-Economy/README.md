# The Economy

In the Last Odyssey rulebook, the word "currency" is shortened to "cr."  This number represents the accumulated gold, silver, bronze, platinum, credits, paperbacks, or any other form of currency the players have accumulated, as well as the various valuable but useless items that the players acquire as loot along their journey.  If GMs and players want to simulate trade as a part of their campaign, they can substitute cr with items of equivalent value.  They should keep track of the corresponding cr value of each given item, and change it over time or over space to represent the forces of supply and demand.

Player characters' main source of income will be the rewards they receive from adventuring.  On occasion, they will find themselves short of money.  When they do, they can resort to bartering, selling, or performing labor to earn more cr.  When players are interested in selling an item, they must find a potential buyer.  Merchants that sell a particular variety of item will buy items of that type back for one half of the cr value of the item rounded down.  If players want to sell an item for a higher price than that, they can do so at a market or they can sell to people who need them badly enough.

If players do not want to or are not able to directly exchange currency, if they are, for example, in a very poor or out of the way settlement, they can also engage in direct barter.  The way barter works is quite simple.  If the players are able to offer the equivalent cr value for an item in other items or above, they can exchange their items for one.  Exchanging an item for a lesser cr value is difficult, and requires either deception or a good relationship with the person being bartered with, and is handled with a Mind skill challenge.

The opportunity to work for a wage will usually present itself to players who are otherwise out of options.  All but the smallest villages have a few forms of employment available.  If players decide to work for money, each "round" of work should take the majority of a single day.  Here are a few examples:
*  Grunt labor, such as working in a mine or on a farm, will pay 1 cr per day.
*  Professional labor that makes use of a character's particular skills will pay 5 cr per day.
*  Specialist labor requires a successful skill challenge of the appropriate type, and will earn players 10 cr per day.
*  Criminal labor, including smuggling and burglary, will net the players 2d8 cr per day and will require a successful skill challenge to avoid facing consequences.
