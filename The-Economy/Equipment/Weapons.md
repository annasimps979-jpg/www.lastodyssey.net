# Weapons

Each [character](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) can wield a single weapon at a time during combat, and may swap out their current weapon for another one they are proficient in during combat with the Swap Weapon action.  All weapons give bonuses to a character's [base](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-base) [Physical Attack](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-attack) and their base [Magical Attack](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-attack) while they are being wielded.  The values of these bonuses are determined by the weapon's Quality and weapon type.  A weapon's _<dfn id = "term-weapon-type">weapon type</dfn>_ determines the base bonuses it gives to the wielder's Physical Attack and Magical Attack.  There are three categories of weapon type: Balanced, Physical, and Magical, and three Qualities, Mundane, Rare, and Expert.  There are also Unique weapons, which are Expert weapons with a single extra weapon upgrade that is not available to any other type.  Each individual weapon type grants an additional unique +1 bonus to a single [statistic](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-statistic) while a character is wielding them that does not count as a bonus on the Bonus Tracker.  There are 9 weapon types in total:
*  Lances grant a +1 bonus to the [Physical Defense](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-defense) of their wielder.
*  Swords grant a +1 bonus to the Physical Attack of their wielder.
*  Bows grant a +1 bonus to the [Physical Accuracy](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-accuracy) of their wielder.
*  Guns grant a +1 bonus to the [Magical Accuracy](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-accuracy) of their wielder.
*  Daggers grant a +1 bonus to the [Evasion](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-evasion) of their wielder.
*  Claws grant a +1 bonus to the [Status Accuracy](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-status-accuracy) of their wielder.
*  Staves grant a +1 bonus to the Magical Attack of their wielder.
*  Fans grant a +1 bonus to the [Magical Defense](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-defense) of their wielder.
*  Scepters grant a +1 bonus to the [Resistance](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-resistance) of their wielder.
