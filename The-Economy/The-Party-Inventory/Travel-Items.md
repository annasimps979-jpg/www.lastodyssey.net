# Travel Items

Some items that [players](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) can purchase do not have utility in [battle](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-battle) but instead during the travel round.  The most basic of these are _<dfn id = "term-supplies">Supplies</dfn>,_ which represent the various kinds of objects a [player character](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player-character) might need while on the road.  A [character](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) may expend 1-3 units of Supplies at any time to create a new object in their inventory that is useful on the road, such as a torch, a lantern, a length of rope, or a set of climbing gear.  This piece of gear will stay in their inventory and occupy an amount of Carrying Capacity equal to the number of Supplies expended to create it, and will last for about as long as it would in real life.  For example, a torch will burn out after a night of use, a lantern after several nights, and climbing gear will stay in a player character's inventory until they take a bad fall or remove it.  Supplies cost 1 cr per unit when bought from a merchant, and each unit of Supplies or item equivalent to a unit of Supplies takes up 1 Carrying Capacity in the [party](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-party) inventory.  When the party is out of Supplies, they also cannot create any more utility items in the manner described in this paragraph.  The amount of Supplies that an item requires will depend on its size and rarity:
*  Small items, such as flint, tinder, or kindling, cost 0 Supplies.
*  Hand-sized items such as kindling, lanterns, or torches cost 1 Supplies.
*  Medium-sized items or items stored in bulk such as lantern fuel or rope cost 2 Supplies.
*  Large items or items that must be carried outside of a pack such as ladders or tents cost 3 Supplies.
*  Items that are larger than a one-person canoe cannot be created with Supplies, and must be bought instead.

_<dfn id = "term-scroll">Scrolls</dfn>_ are single-use magic items that allow player characters to use extra actions during the camping phase that cause effects during the next day.  Each Scroll is single-use, requires one player to use their camping action to activate, and takes effect during the following travel round.  All Scrolls take up 1 Carrying Capacity in the party inventory.

|Name|Cost|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
