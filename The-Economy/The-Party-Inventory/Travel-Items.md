# Travel Items

Some items that [players](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) can purchase do not have utility in [battle](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-battle) but instead during [exploration](../../Exploration-Rules/).  The most basic of these are _<dfn id = "term-supplies">Supplies</dfn>,_ which represent the various kinds of objects a [player character](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player-character) might need while on the road.  A [character](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) may expend 1-3 units of Supplies at any time to create a new object in their [inventory](../../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory/) that is useful on the road, such as a torch, a lantern, a length of rope, or a set of climbing gear.  This piece of gear will stay in their inventory and occupy an amount of [Carrying Capacity](../../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory#term-carrying-capacity) equal to the number of Supplies expended to create it, and will last for about as long as it would in real life.  For example, a torch will burn out after a night of use, a lantern after several nights, and climbing gear will stay in a player character's inventory until they take a bad fall or remove it.  Supplies cost 1 [cr](../../The-Economy#term-cr) per unit when bought from a [merchant](../../The-Economy/Merchants), and each unit of Supplies or item equivalent to a unit of Supplies has an [item rating](../../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory#term-item-rating) of 1.  The amount of Supplies that an item requires will depend on its size and rarity:
*  Small items, such as flint, tinder, or kindling, cost 0 Supplies.
*  Hand-sized items such as kindling, lanterns, or torches cost 1 Supplies.
*  Medium-sized items or items stored in bulk such as lantern fuel or rope cost 2 Supplies.
*  Large items or items that must be carried outside of a pack such as ladders or tents cost 3 Supplies.
*  Items that are larger than a one-person canoe cannot be created with Supplies, and must be bought instead.

## Travel Item Effects

|<dfn id = "term-cloak">Cloak</dfn>|1|Mundane 5, Rare 25, Expert 75 cr|Special pieces of equipment that protect from the elements.  A player character may wear one Cloak at a time.  Cloaks do not count as accessories when worn.  The number of different varieties of weather a Cloak is proofed for and how much it costs depends on its Quality; a Mundane Cloak has one type of proofing, a Rare one has two, and an Expert one has three.  There are four possible proofing types: Sunproof, Heatproof, Waterproof, and Coldproof.|
|Bag|0|Mundane 10, Rare 25, Expert 50 cr|Encompasses backpacks, rucksacks, and any other equipment that allows characters to store items.  A character may wear only one Bag at a time.  A Mundane Bag provides 10 extra Carrying Capacity, a Rare Bag provides 25, and an Expert Bag provides 50.|
|<dfn id = "term-map">Map</dfn>|1|Mundane 50, Rare 250, Expert 500 cr|A map of an area reduces the [navigation difficulty](../../Exploration-Rules/Nodes-and-Paths#term-navigation-difficulty) of traveling the [paths](../../Exploration-Rules/Nodes-and-Paths#term-path) that it depicts by an amount that depends on its Quality.  Mundane maps reduce the navigation difficulty by 1, Rare by 3, and Expert by 7.|

_<dfn id = "term-scroll">Scrolls</dfn>_ are single-use items that allow player characters to use extra actions during the [Camping Phase](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-camping-phase) that cause effects during the next day.  Each Scroll is single-use and has an item rating of 1.

|Name|Cost|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Stormbreaker|250 cr|This Scroll can only be used during a [Storm](../../Exploration-Rules/Weather-and-Climate#term-storm).  When rolling to determine the day's weather, the [GM](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-gm) must reroll until the result is something other than a Storm.|
|Divine Weather|100 cr|Activating this Scroll allows you to automatically succeed at the [Divine](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-divine-action) action.|
|Scrying|500 cr|Activating this Scroll allows you to automatically succeed at the [Scout](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-scout-action) action.  It can also let you sense danger in the nearby vicinity when not traveling.|
|Clear Weather|100 cr|If the weather is not a Storm, the next day's weather will be [Sunny](../../Exploration-Rules/Weather-and-Climate#term-sunny).  This Scroll cannot be used during a Storm.|
|Shadow|1000 cr|If used during travel, the following day's [danger rating](../../Exploration-Rules/Nodes-and-Paths#term-danger-rating) is reduced by 4.  If used outside of travel, this will obscure the player characters for 1d4 hours or until they do something that would reveal their presence.|
|Forest Walk|1200 cr|This will let player characters bypass a [natural hazard](../../Exploration-Rules/Hazards-and-Encounters#term-natural-hazard) without making use of Supplies or a [skill challenge](../../Free-Play/Skill-Challenges).  It can also be used during the Camping Phase to reduce the navigation difficulty for the following day by 6.  Outside of travel, it can also temporarily clear paths of any naturally occurring difficult terrain, such as thick underbrush or muddy ground.|
|Bell|100 cr|Using this during travel will guarantee that an enemy [encounter](../../Enemies/Encounter-Creation) will happen the following day.  Using this outside of travel will alert nearby hostiles to the players' presence, drawing them into a fight.|
|Reveal the Path|500 cr|The players will always succeed on their [navigation roll](../../Exploration-Rules/The-Travel-Round#term-navigation-roll) during the following day.|
|Mark|5000 cr|Creates a magical circle on the ground that players can use Recall scrolls to teleport back to.  The presence of a Mark circle is detectable by anyone with magical talent who knows what they are looking for.|
|Recall|1000 cr|Recalls the entire party to the presence of a Mark circle.  If it would be physically impossible to teleport there, the Recall Scroll fails and is consumed.|
