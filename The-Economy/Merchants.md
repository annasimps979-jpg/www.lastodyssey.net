# Merchants

While in a settlement, player characters will often need to replenish their items and upgrade their equipment, which means that they will need to visit _<dfn id = "term-merchant">merchants</dfn>._  The following section will outline how to create merchants to add to the game world that players can buy goods and services from, including extensive guides for generating new ones at the appropriate tier for the players.  GMs are not obligated to follow any of the guidelines here, but making bespoke item arrays for each storekeeper can be very time-consuming, and so it is recommended that they make extensive use of the framework in this section as they create their worlds.

It is advised that the GM not create merchants totally on the fly, but rather do so during preparation for their game.  In addition to merchants they place in particular settlements, they can also create a few merchants to have in their back pocket in case players go looking in unexpected places or encounter one on the road.  When generating a new merchant with the rules in this section, GMs need to choose their _<dfn id = "term-merchant-theme">theme</dfn>,_ which is the type of vendor they are, and their _<dfn id = "term-merchant-rating">rating</dfn>,_ which is a number from 1-6 that determines how rare their goods are.  They should then consult the merchant themes listed in this section and the rules for item generation in the [Battle Items](../The-Economy/The-Party-Inventory/Battle-Items) section to determine which items the merchant sells.  If they would like to add more variety, they may also add a few other items to the merchant's inventory to create a stronger sense of differentiation in addition to giving players the opportunity to buy items they will need on their quest.  In general, merchants ought to stock items that players can afford, although it can often be interesting to deliberately include a few items that players cannot afford yet as a way to pique their interest.  In gameplay terms, merchants of rating 1-2 are balanced for characters of tier 1-4, merchants of rating 3-4 are balanced for characters of tier 5-7, and merchants of rating 5-6 are balanced for characters of tier 8-10.

## Generating Merchants
GMs who are feeling intrepid can come up with their own themes, but by default there are six varieties of specialized merchant that players will encounter on their journey:
* _<dfn id = "term-blacksmith-merchant">Blacksmiths</dfn>_ are metalworkers and artisans who specialize in creating weapons of war.
* _<dfn id = "term-alchemist-merchant">Alchemists</dfn>_ are chemical specialists, who brew poisons, bombs, and other mixtures.
* _<dfn id = "term-apothecary-merchant">Apothecaries</dfn>_ sell healing potions, tinctures, and cures for various ailments.
* _<dfn id = "term-machinist-merchant">Machinists</dfn>_ work with cutting-edge technology, whether clockwork or digital.
* _<dfn id = "term-sorcerer-merchant">Sorcerers</dfn>_ specialize in hexes and offensive magic, and tend to be reclusive.
* _<dfn id = "term-ranger-merchant">Rangers</dfn>_ are practitioners of natural magic and experts in survival.

### Other Merchants

The vast majority of merchants will have storefronts where there are potential customers.  Most villages will have a blacksmith, an apothecary, and possibly a ranger, while most towns and all cities will have markets in addition to at least one of each type of merchant.  To add flavor, GMs can create merchant themes that do not follow the typical types outlined above.  Here are some suggestions:
*  A merchant that specializes in selling a particular type of rare good, such as Summon Creature battle items.
*  A merchant that specializes in selling all [elemental types](../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-elemental-type) of a common good, such as a merchant who only sells Magical or Physical Damage items.
*  A merchant whose items all have a particular enhancement, such as Random or All.
*  A merchant that sells items for unusually low or high prices, up to an order of magnitude above or below the norm.
*  A merchant that sells items that have unknown effects or effects that the merchant lies about.  This should be done rarely, both to ensure that players are surprised and also to ensure that they don't get too paranoid about the goods they are buying.
*  A traveling peddler who sells 2d6 totally random items.

Not every item needs to be sold by a specialist.  In particular, Supplies and Fuel are usually sold in taverns and at any rest stations the players encounter on the road.  Some towns and most cities and metropoli will also have a local market, where merchants can unload any goods they think the locals might buy.  Markets have a broad variety of items whose availability is less restrictive than those sold by shopkeepers.  To generate a marketplace, the GM can generate or create by hand 1d20 random items that might be available to players when they stop by.  GMs can change the availability of items at the market if they want to create a more realistic and dynamic feel.  Finding truly rare or unique items might even be the subject of an investigation roll, in which case the resulting questions the players can ask are replaced by a list of rare items they can buy in addition to the items that the GM already generated.

### Step-By-Step Creation
To generate a new merchant, the GM should walk through the following steps:
1.  Choose the merchant's theme.  This can either be one of the listed six themes or a custom theme.
2.  Set the merchant's rating.  This determines the Item Values of their goods, and which goods they have available.
3.  Decide on an aesthetic theme for the items the merchant is selling.  Are they mechanical or magical?  What kinds of materials are they made of?  Are any of them alive?
4.  Generate the merchant's inventory based on their theme and rating, either randomly or by hand.
5.  Determine where the store is and what it looks like.  Is it a first-floor rental unit with glass windows?  A tower?  A tent on the outskirts of town?
6.  Name the shopkeeper(s) and write down a few details about their behavior.  Are they harried or relaxed?  Curt or friendly?  How do they treat their employees, if they have any?  How do they treat their customers?
