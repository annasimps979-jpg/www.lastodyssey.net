# Character Advancement

Over time, players will earn [XP](../Free-Play/Earning-XP#term-xp), which can be spent to make their [characters](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) more powerful by increasing their [attributes](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-attribute) and unlocking new [abilities](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability).  A character's level of advancement in relation to other characters is represented by its [tier](../Characters/Character-Creation#term-tier).  [Players](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player) can spend XP on four distinct improvements to their character: unlocking a new [job](../Characters/Jobs/) or unlocking a talent for one they already have, taking what's known as a flex power, adding 1 to one of their attributes, and advancing 3 total ranks in any jobs they are currently have access to.  The last two of these can be done twice per tier, while the first two can only be done once.  To learn more about how characters earn XP, see the [Earning XP](../Free-Play/Earning-XP) section.

The XP cost of each improvement a character buys is equal to the number of improvements they have already bought at their current tier plus one, multiplied by twice their current tier, as shown in the table below.  For example, at tier 1 the very first improvement a character buys will cost 2 XP, while the last one will cost 12 XP.  Once a character has reached tier 10 and then unlocked all of the possible advancements, they may no longer advance in tier.  If a character in your [campaign](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-campaign) reaches max level, this means that it's time for the campaign to start wrapping up and/or for that character to move on and be changed out for another one.  Every time you advance in tier, you also gain access to the [archetype](../Characters/Archetypes/) ability or [statistic](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-statistic) bonus of the corresponding rank.

When a character first advances to a new tier, they also advance the rank of their archetype and gain the corresponding advancement.  While they occupy a given tier, each character will take each of advancements listed below one single time.  Once these advancements have been taken, they must advance to the next tier to advance further.

In total, once per tier, a character can take each of the following advancements:
*  Advance 3 total Ranks in jobs.
*  Advance 3 total Ranks in jobs.
*  Advance a single attribute by 1.
*  Advance a different attribute by 1.
*  Unlock a new job or unlock a talent.
*  Learn a flex power.

## Advancing Attributes
When a player chooses to advance one of their character's attributes, they add +1 to either their [Body](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body), their [Mind](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind), or their [Spirit](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit).  The next time they take this improvement during the same tier, they must improve a different attribute.  The maximum value that any of a character's attributes can have is 12.

## Advancing Jobs
Whenever a player advances their character's rank in a job, they are then able to use all of the abilities associated with that rank or lower while they occupy it.  Players can save up ranks whenever they take this improvement until they are ready, but they cannot spend them except when they take this improvement again.  Unlocking the capstone ability at the end of a job's ability list costs 2 ranks of advancement instead of 1.

## Unlocking Jobs and Talents
Every tier, players may either choose to give their character a talent or unlock a new job.  When a character unlocks a new job, they may now occupy it during [combat](../Combat-Rules/) and gain the associated exploration [action](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-action) during travel.  When they first unlock a job, it starts at rank 1.

Instead of unlocking a new job, a player can instead choose to unlock one of the talents listed in their archetype description.  Each _<dfn id = "term-talent">talent</dfn>_ is a passive ability that is only active when a character occupies the corresponding job.  There are six talents available to unlock per archetype, one for each job.

## Flex Powers
When a character takes this improvement, they gain an extra ability called a _<dfn id = "term-flex-power">flex power</dfn>_ that they can use regardless of what job they currently occupy.  Characters may not take the same type of flex power more than once.  For example, a character could have Water Strike and Water Bolt, but could not have two Water Bolt abilities that were both flex powers.  Characters may, however, take the flex power versions of abilities that they also have access to in a particular job.  This means that a character could have Water Bolt as a [Caster](../Characters/Jobs/Caster) ability and Water Bolt as a flex power, but would only be able to use the flex power version of Water Bolt unless they were currently a Caster.  This rule also does not apply to Flex Statistic, which can be taken an indefinite number of times per statistic.

During character advancement, players may purchase any of the following flex powers:

|Name|[Type](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-ability-type)|Cost|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Flex [Buff](../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-buff)|[Ally](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-ally-ability)|10 [MP](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mp), 1 AP|When you take this power, choose one of the nine character statistics.  Using this ability raises the specified statistic of the target by one level on the [Bonus Tracker](../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-bonus-tracker).|
|Flex [Debuff](../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-debuff)|[Ranged](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-ranged)|6 MP, 1 [AP](../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-ap)|When you take this power, choose one of the nine character statistics.  Using this ability lowers the specified statistic of the target by one level on the Bonus Tracker.|
|Flex Bolt|Ranged|10 MP, 1 AP|When you take this power, choose a non-[colorless](../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-colorless) [elemental type](../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-elemental-type).

|Flex Strike|[Melee](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-melee)|10 MP, 1 AP|When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.

|Flex Debilitate|Ranged|14 MP, 1 AP|When you take this power, choose a [status](../Combat-Rules/Statuses) with an elemental type.  Using this ability triggers a [status-inflicting ability](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-status-inflicting-ability) against a single target that inflicts this status on a hit.|
|Flex Shell|Ally|14 MP, 1 AP|When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  Using this ability increases the [Shell](../Combat-Rules/Shells) of a single target by your current [Magical Attack](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-attack).  This power works the same as the [Support's](../Characters/Jobs/Support) Shell ability.|
|Flex Protect|Ally|18 MP, 1 AP|When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  Using this ability makes you or a single ally Protected against that elemental type.|
|Flex Statistic|[Passive](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-passive)|N/A|You gain a permanent +5 bonus to your character's [Health](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-health), +5 bonus to their [Mana](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mana), or a +2 bonus to their [Initiative](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-initiative).|
|Flex Proficiency|Passive|N/A|You become [proficient](../Characters/Character-Creation#term-weapon-proficiency) in a type of weapon or armor you were not previously proficient in.|

## Advancing Tier
Once you have bought one of each of the six tier improvements, your character is ready to advance in tier.  To do so, you must spend 3 [Anima](../Free-Play/Anima#term-anima) to either summon their [eidolon](../Characters/Eidolons#term-eidolon) in battle or to save them from [True Death](../Free-Play/True-Death).  Once this has been done, the character advances to the next tier, and automatically receives the advancement corresponding to the rank of their archetype equal to their new tier.  

## Changing Aspirations and Relationships
It is inevitable that a character's [Aspiration](../Characters/Character-Creation#term-aspiration) and [Relationships](../Characters/Character-Creation#term-relationship) will change throughout the course of a campaign.  The outcome of a Scene may change a character's Relationships or Aspiration, depending on what was risked in order for them to earn Anima.  In addition, whenever player determines that their character's Aspiration has changed and/or they have acquired or lost a Relationship, they have the ability to modify them at will.  They should then announce this to the group so that the other players and the [GM](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-gm) can take proper note of the change.
