# Support

Supports specialize in [buffs](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-buff), [Shells](../../Combat-Rules/Shells), and beneficial [statuses](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses).

*  Their [Physical Defense](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-defense) is increased by an amount equal to their [Body](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-body).
*  Their [Magical Defense](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-defense) is increased by an amount equal to their [Mind](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mind).
*  Their [Magical Attack](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-attack) is increased by an amount equal to their [Spirit](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-spirit).
