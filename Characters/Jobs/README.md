# Jobs

The _<dfn id = "term-job">job</dfn>_ a character currently occupies determines their role in [combat](../../Combat-Rules/).  Each character may invest in any and all of the available jobs in Last Odyssey, but may only occupy one job at a time.  Out of combat, they may switch between jobs at will, while in combat they must switch jobs during the [Paradigm Phase](../../Combat-Rules/The-Combat-Round#term-paradigm-phase).  While they occupy a job, they may use any of the abilities that you have unlocked via [character advancement](../../Characters/Character-Advancement) except for the capstone [ability](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability), which can only be used by their [eidolon](../../Characters/Eidolons#term-eidolon).  Any of the unlocked [passive](../../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-passive) abilities for a job, such as Trained Spellcaster, only apply if the character currently occupies the job.  In addition, they gain extra bonuses to three different [statistics](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-statistic) equal to their three [attributes](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-attribute).

In Last Odyssey, there are six distinct jobs: Striker, Caster, Healer, Defender, Support, and Saboteur.
*  [Striker:](Striker) An offensive job focused on doing damage to the [front row](../../Combat-Rules/Starting-Battles#term-front-row).
*  [Caster:](Caster) An offensive job focused on doing damage to the entire battlefield.
*  [Healer:](Healer) A defensive job focused on healing and removing [statuses](../../Combat-Rules/Statuses) from allies.
*  [Defender:](Defender) A defensive job focused on drawing enemy attacks and negating received damage.
*  [Support:](Support) A defensive job focused on [buffing](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-buff) allies and protecting them from [elemental](../../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-elemental-type) damage.
*  [Saboteur:](Saboteur) An offensive job focused on [debuffing](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-debuff) enemies and making them vulnerable to elemental damage.
