# Jobs

The _<dfn id = "term-job">job</dfn>_ a character currently occupies determines their role in combat.  Each character may invest in any and all of the available jobs in Last Odyssey, but may only occupy one job at a time.  Out of combat, they may switch between jobs at will, while in combat they must switch jobs during the Paradigm Phase.  While they occupy a job, they may use any of the abilities that you have unlocked via character advancement except for the capstone ability, which can only be used by their [eidolon](../../Characters/Eidolons#term-eidolon).  Any of the unlocked passive abilities for a job, such as Trained Spellcaster, only apply if the character currently occupies the job.  In addition, they gain extra bonuses to three different statistics equal to their three attributes.

In Last Odyssey, there are six distinct jobs: Striker, Caster, Healer, Defender, Support, and Saboteur.
*  [Striker:](Striker) An offensive job focused on doing damage to the front row.
*  [Caster:](Caster) An offensive job focused on doing damage to the entire battlefield.
*  [Healer:](Healer) A defensive job focused on healing and removing status effects from allies.
*  [Defender:](Defender) A defensive job focused on drawing enemy attacks and negating received damage.
*  [Support:](Support) A defensive job focused on buffing allies and protecting them from elemental damage.
*  [Saboteur:](Saboteur) An offensive job focused on debuffing enemies and making them vulnerable to elemental damage.
