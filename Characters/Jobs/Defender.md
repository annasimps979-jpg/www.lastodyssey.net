## Abilities by Rank

|Rank|Name|Type|Cost|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Taunt|Ranged|1 AP|Inflict the Taunted status on a single target.  A Taunted [character](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) can only use single-target magical attacks, physical attacks, and status-inflicting [abilities](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability), and only on you.  It can also use the Move [action](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-action) to move into range of you if needed.  Each character can only be Taunted by a single other character at a time.  If the character cannot reach you by any means, they will act as though they are not Taunted.|
|2|Guard|Ally|5 [MP](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-mp), 1 AP|Inflict the Guarded status on a single ally, which remains until the beginning of your next turn.  Every time that ally is targeted by a physical attack, magical attack, or status-inflicting ability, you become the target instead.  If they are targeted by a Multi- or All-type ability, the ability is simply negated against them.|

|10|Mirror Shield|Self|1 Anima, 2 AP|Inflict the Mirrored status effect on your eidolon, which goes away at the beginning of its next turn.
