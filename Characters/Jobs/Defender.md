The Defender specializes in drawing and negating the effects of enemy attacks.

While they are a Defender, characters gain the following bonuses to their statistics:
*  Their Physical Defense is increased by their Body.
*  Their Resistance is increased by their Mind.
*  Their Magical Defense is increased by their Spirit.

Abilities by Rank:

**Rank 1:** Taunt. Ranged. Cost: 1 AP.  Inflict the Taunted status on a single target.  A Taunted character can only use single-target magical attacks, physical attacks, and status-inflicting abilities, and only on you.  It can also use the Move action to move into range of you if needed.  Each character can only be Taunted by a single other character at a time.  If the character cannot reach you by any means, they will act as though they are not Taunted.

**Rank 2:** Guard. Ally. Cost: 5 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Guarded status on a single ally, which remains until the beginning of your next turn.  Every time that ally is targeted by a physical attack, magical attack, or status-inflicting ability, you become the target instead.  If they are targeted by a Multi- or All-type ability, the ability is simply negated against them.

**Rank 3:** Shield. Self. Cost: 7 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Shielded status effect on yourself.  While you are Shielded, if you are hit by a physical attack the damage dealt to you is automatically reduced to 0 and the Shielded status effect is removed.

**Rank 4:** Counter. Self. Cost: 7 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Countering status effect on yourself.  While you are Countering, the next time you are hit with a physical attack the attacker takes damage as though they were also a target of the same attack and the Countering status is removed.

**Rank 5:** Multitaunt. Multi. Cost: 9 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Taunted status on every enemy on the battlefield.

**Rank 6:** Multiguard. Multi. Cost: 10 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Guarded status on all of your allies.

**Rank 7:** Barrier. Self. Cost: 9 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Barred status effect on yourself.  While you are Barred, if you are hit by a magical attack the damage dealt to you is automatically reduced to 0 and the Barred status effect is removed.

**Rank 8:** Reflect. Self. Cost: 12 MP, 1 AP.  Inflict the Reflecting status effect on yourself.  While you are Reflecting, the next time you are hit with a magical attack the attacker takes damage as though they were also a target of the same attack and the Reflecting status is removed.

**Rank 9:** Deathless. Passive.  When you are hit with an attack that would otherwise down you while at anything but 1 HP and 0 Shell, you are instead reduced to 1 HP and 0 Shell.

**Capstone:** Mirror Shield. Self. Cost: 1 Anima, 2 AP.  Inflict the Mirrored status effect on your eidolon, which goes away at the beginning of its next turn.  While your eidolon is Mirrored, all magical attacks, physical attacks, and status-inflicting abilities are negated and reflected back onto the enemy that used them.
