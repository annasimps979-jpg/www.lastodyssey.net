Advancements by Rank:

**Rank 1:** Mark Target. Ranged. Cost: 1 AP.  This ability inflicts the Hunted status effect on the target.  When you use a magical attack, physical attack, or status-inflicting ability on the target, you roll the hit die twice and choose the number you prefer.  This does not apply to attacks that target multiple enemies.  Only one enemy can have the Hunted status effect inflicted on them per Ranger on your team.  If a Hunted enemy dies due to one of your attacks, you may immediately use Mark Target on another enemy at no AP cost.

**Rank 2:** You gain +1 Physical Accuracy.

**Rank 3:** Forest Walk. Passive. You are immune to having your movement impaired for any reason, and immune to any effects that force you to move.  You may still be moved by friendly powers such as the Commander's Order.

**Rank 4:** You gain +1 Physical Accuracy.

**Rank 5:** Lay Trap. Special. Cost: 5 MP, 1 AP.  Designate either the front row or the back row of the enemies' side of the battlefield.  The next time an enemy moves into this row, you may either make a basic attack against them, rolling the hit die twice as though they were Hunted, or use Mark Target on them, without spending any AP.

**Rank 6:** You gain +1 Physical Accuracy.

**Rank 7:** Cripple. Passive.  All allies that attack a Hunted enemy now gain the advantage of Hunted.

**Rank 8:** You gain +1 Physical Accuracy.

**Rank 9:** You gain +1 Physical Accuracy.

**Capstone:** Wild Hunt. Multi. Cost: 1 Anima, 2 AP.  Applies Hunted to all enemies and then makes a basic attack against each one.

Talents:

**Striker:** True Strike.  When you use a physical attack against a Hunted enemy, you may remove the Hunted status effect in order to guarantee that you hit regardless of the result of the hit die.

**Caster:** Detonate.  When an enemy triggers the effect of Lay Trap, you may use a single-target magical attack against them rather than a basic attack.  When you do so, you may roll the hit die twice and choose the result you prefer.

**Healer:** Rescuscitate.  You may use your Mark Target ability to apply the Watched status to one of your allies. When they drop to 0 HP or below, the Watched status is removed, and they regain an amount of HP equal to your magical attack as a Healer.  Only one ally may be Watched by you at a time.

**Defender:** Forcefield.  You may use the Mark Target ability to apply the Defended status to an ally.  The next time they are hit by a status-inflicting ability, a magical attack, or a physical attack, the damage or status is negated.  Only one ally may be Defended by you at a time.

**Support:** Herbal Medicine.  You may use the Mark Target ability to apply the Treated status to an ally.  Treated allies ignore the cumulative effects of all debuffs that have been applied to them, although this does not affect the position of any of their statistics on the Bonus Tracker.

**Saboteur:** Poison Arrow.  When an enemy is affected by the Lay Trap ability, you may choose to use a single-target status-inflicting ability on them instead of using your basic attack.  When you do so, roll the hit die as though the enemy were Hunted.
