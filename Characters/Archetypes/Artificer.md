## Talents

**[Striker](../../Characters/Jobs/Striker):** Sniper.  When you use an item that does physical damage to an enemy, you may add your Physical Attack to its [base](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-base) damage.

**[Caster](../../Characters/Jobs/Caster):** Magic Ammo.  When you use an item that does magical damage to an enemy, you may add your [Magical Attack](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-magical-attack) to its base damage.

**[Healer](../../Characters/Jobs/Healer):** First Aid.  When you use an item that heals an ally, you may add your Magical Attack to its base healing.

**[Defender](../../Characters/Jobs/Defender):** Optimize Defenses.  If you use the Scan ability on an ally, it inflicts the Optimized status on them.  The next physical attack, magical attack, or status-inflicting ability that hits them will ignore any of their weaknesses.  The Optimized status is then removed.

**Support:** Targeting Systems.  When you use Scan on an ally, they gain a temporary +5 to their [Physical](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-physical-accuracy), Magical, and [Status Accuracies](../../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-status-accuracy) until the end of their next turn that does not count on the [Bonus Tracker](../../Combat-Rules/Buffs-and-Debuffs#term-bonus-tracker).

**Saboteur:** Monkeywrench.  When you use an item that inflicts a status on an enemy, you may subtract your Status Accuracy from the result on the [hit die](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-hit-die) to determine if they are hit.
