# Tier 6 Enemies

## Chaos Elementals
The Elemental Boundary of the cosmos will sometimes leak into the Material Plane.  When it does, aspects of the elements will be "embodied" in elementals.  Elementals are hostile, and quite insane.

There is nothing discernible elementals usually "want."  They simply act on instinct, using powers associated with their given element almost at random.  They won't use any [actions](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-action) in battle other than their [abilities](../../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability), and won't use these abilities in a tactical manner, instead just lashing out at the nearest target.

## Sahuagin
Tidewater regions that are not populated by humans or other sentients are usually inhabited by sahuagin, which are half-fish people that have their own strange customs.

Sahuagin are somewhat physically weak, and as a result will focus on wearing their enemies down and frustrating them in the hopes that they will make stupid mistakes.
