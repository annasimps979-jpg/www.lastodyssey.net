# Tier 4 Enemies

## Gangsters
The people who run the casinos that act as sieves for the vast wealth trafficked through Neon Station are highly unpredictable, but almost always violent.

In combat, Gangsters will beat on the weakest enemy.  They will also never engage in a fair fight unless forced to.
