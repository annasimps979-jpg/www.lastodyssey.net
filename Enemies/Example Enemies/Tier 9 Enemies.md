# Tier 9 Enemies

## Invaders
Alternate dimensions contain sentients of their own.  While most transdimensional denizens are benign, those that willingly choose to colonize other dimensions often aren't.

Invaders don't follow too many rules in combat, except for one: do whatever the players expect the least at any given time.

## Robots
Advanced artificial minds often enact their will via numerous servitors, some of which are also equipped for battle.
