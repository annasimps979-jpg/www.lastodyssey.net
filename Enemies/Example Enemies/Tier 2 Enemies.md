## Forest Dwellers
The deep woods are home to hostile creatures that will defend their territory to the death, although they will also grant boons to travelers they trust.

Forest Dwellers are interested in murdering their opponents with as little fanfare as possible.  The exception to this is that they will prioritize survival in combat over a quicker end to things.  You will see them choose to use healing abilities even when it isn't strictly needed, and playing it safe with buffs and debuffs.
