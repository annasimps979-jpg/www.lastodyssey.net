# Shells

Shell [abilities](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-ability) apply a special status effect on their target known as a _<dfn id = "term-shell">Shell</dfn>._  A Shell is a pool of temporary [HP](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-hp) that has a fixed [elemental type](../Combat-Rules/Elemental-Types#term-elemental-type).  When a [character](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-character) has a Shell applied to them, they will take double damage from all [magical attacks](../Combat-Rules/Attacking-and-Defending#term-magical-attack).  In addition, when determining the elemental multiplier to the damage they take or to their status effect modifier, you should take the target's elemental type to be the element of the Shell.  No character, with the exception of some Antagonists, may have more than one Shell of a given elemental type active at a time, and no [player character](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-player-character) may ever have more Shell than their [base](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-base) [Health](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-health).  Enemies also begin [battle](../Extras/Key-Terms#term-battle) with their maximum Shell already applied.  An enemy's maximum Shell is determined by the starting Shell they have in [combat](../Combat-Rules/), and they cannot receive a Shell higher than this of any elemental type.

When a character's Shell is reduced to zero, they are referred to as _<dfn id = "term-shellbroken">Shellbroken</dfn>._  When a character's Shell is first broken by an attack, subtract the amount of damage the attack did to the character's Shell from the total final damage of the attack, modifiers included.  If the resulting number is greater than the character's remaining HP, the character is [downed](../Characters/Attributes-and-Statistics#term-downed).  If the resulting number is less than the character's remaining HP, they do not take any additional damage.
